<div id="about">
I am a BCS of the University of Manitoba working in the field of Software Development. Agrypnia was created 
using Pico and Twig which uses both markdown and php.
This is a repository for personal use of all material authored by me, John Xie. My current focus is towards
C#, WCF, WPF, and some web development. Gradually, this site will converge towards blogs and notes 
towards work and tips discovered during my free time.
